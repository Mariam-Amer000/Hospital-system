# 🏥 Hospital Management System  

This is a **simple hospital management system** implemented in **C++**.  

## 🎯 Purpose  
The main goal of this project is to **practice and apply** the programming concepts I have learned.  

## 📚 Concepts Applied  
1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation  
2. **Data Structures (DSA)** – queues, vectors, and efficient data management  
3. **File Handling** – storing and retrieving records (patients, doctors, staff)  
4. **Error Handling** – managing invalid inputs and exceptions  

## ⚡ Note  
This project is **not a fully professional hospital system**.  
It is a **practice project** created to strengthen my skills in **C++, OOP, and DSA**.
